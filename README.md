This repo contains basic working app with no bonus
- UI According to Figma
- pull to refresh
- image, name, description, positive vote count display correctly

****Bug****
- image name in some cells are overlap. not sure why. seems to randomly appear when scroll down and up. easy fix by pull to refresh but non sustainable. 
- some description constraints are weirdly spaced out from title. might have something to do with dynamic cell height.
